## Spotify

Consumes the Spotify API and returns a list of related artists.

#### Instructions:
Run `node index.js artist1 artist2`, where artist1 and artist2 are the names of the artists you want to search for related artists between. Searching for 1 artist is currently not supported, and will return an empty array. Additional arguments are simply ignored.
